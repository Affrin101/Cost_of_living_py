# Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data Science research group interested in World economy

Target audience: Graduating students looking to start their careers and life

Students completing their degree spend the last 3 to 4 months of their last semester wondering: what next? Students who are looking to work after graduating especially have questions about the current job market, companies and whether they will be able to afford moving to a new country or city for a job. Our dashboard aims to ease the decision making for the last factor mentioned. We aim to provide an interactive tool for users to observe the cost of living in 160 cities located across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia with the ability to explore different factors that affect monthly expenditures. Additionally, they will  be able to visually compare cost of living in different cities at once. Finally, we will provide visualizations for those who are looking to buy properties or see how prices compare spatially. Using this data visualization app, graduating students will be able to make more informed decisions about their life and careers after college. 

# Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

Our project answers the broad research question of: “What is the average
cost of living for a single fresh graduate in different cities in the
world?”. Below we have provided a usage scenario of our product by a
member of our target audience:

Bella is a fresh graduate in Canada and her current marital status is
single. She wants to seek for a job and settle down in some major cities
in the world, but she has concerns about the high living cost in big cities,
including housing, grocery, transportation, entertainment, shopping and
others. In order to help her get a general idea of how much the living
cost is in different major cities in the world, our app provides
immediate visualization of living cost in USD among 160 big cities from
90 countries in the world. Bella is also curious about the property
price and monthly saving as she might want to buy her own house in the
future. Our app takes her concern into account and can display the
property prices per square meter as well as the average monthly surplus
for people living in different cities.
