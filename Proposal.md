# Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

Our project answers the broad research question of: “What is the average
cost of living for a single fresh graduate in different cities in the
world?”. Below we have provided a usage scenario of our product by a
member of our target audience:

Bella is a fresh graduate in Canada and her current marital status is
single. She wants to seek for a job and settle down in some major cities
in the world, but she concerns about the high living cost in big cities,
including housing, grocery, transportation, entertainment, shopping and
so on. In order to help her get a general idea of how much the living
cost is in different major cities in the world, our app provides
immediate visualization of living cost in USD among 160 big cities from
90 countries in the world. Bella is also curious about the property
price and monthly saving as she might want to buy her own house in the
future. Our app takes her concern into account and can display the
property prices per square meter as well as the average monthly surplus
for people living in different cities.
