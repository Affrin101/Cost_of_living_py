# Reflections

We thoroughly enjoyed the experience of building the app from scratch. Learnt so many new and cool features and troed implementing them to the best of ur abilities.
While we were successfully able to implementing all the major plots and aspects of our dashboard that we had originally proposed, there is still room for improvement. 

* Simplicity and easy to use features were the most important factors that we kept on our minds while designing this app and so was the feedback recieved from our peers.
* Our peers had given a positive feedback that the Green side bar on our app where we have the selection menu is very attractive and they also wanted to includ ethe same in their app.Other than that we donot feel there any reoccuring themes in our app which eeds improvement
* The major difference between our DashR and DashPy app is that in DashR we have the option of choosing cities based on single Region whereas in DashPy we have the option of choosing cities based on multiple region. We wanted to make the remove multi selection feature from DashPy but the selection of dropdown menu is dynamic based on radioitems hence customising the multi selection option for dynamic dropdown was very challenging. We spent couple of hours debugging it but couldnot achiev it hence left it as is.
* Since multiple Regions are getting selected in the DashPy app hence we couldnot implement the TA's feedback of zooming in on the map based on the region selected.Although we were able to achieve it on our DashR app
* We also wanted to add interactivity between each plots in the app using altair as per the peer feedback but doing so hampered our dashboards layout hence we decided to not add that feature.
* We are very happy to recieve very constructive feedbacks from our peers and tried to implement as many of them as we could. We added the tooltip to give us more information about the values in the plot
* Earlier our multi-selection feature didnot function as intended, as the map plot was not able to filter when multiple regions were chosen but we were able to **fix** it and it works as were had earlier planned it to.
* We imporved the axis labels of few plots to make it more human interpretable
* We felt that the map didnot fit well in the dbc Card, hence we fixed the size of the plot to avoid scrolling horizontaly or vertically
* As suggested by our peers, we added placholders for the "Region/Cities" dropdown for better understanding of the users.
* We added an additional tab which explains "how the app works" to help new users navigate easily
* Earlier we had the option of selecting single category of cost from the dropdown however taking the peer feedback seriouly we made alteration to allow the user 
to select multiple 'monthly cost' options, so that they can see the cumulative cost of many different expenses 

We are very satisfied with app taht we have created so far.Morever we had a great learning experience while working on this project and this group.
