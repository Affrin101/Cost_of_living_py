# Reflection

Working on implementing our dashboard this milestone was very exciting, enjoyable, and challenging for us. While we were successfully able to implement all the major plots and aspects of our dashboard, there is still room for improvement. 

Starting with what our project does well, we were able to tie the plots to the drop down menus and fill-in options given to users depending on what cities and monthly costs they wanted to compare. We were able to implement the fundamental functionalities of all the plots mentioned in the proposal. We were able to achieve the general designs we wanted for the dashboard and it resembles what we imagined it to be. 

However we did face challenges and there are still things we would like to work on. Firstly, we were not able to implement interactivity between plots, in the future we would do this especially with the world map plot, where clicking on a specific region would change the rest of the plots showing those regions’ cities in more detail. Additionally, we need to change the functionality of the drop down option when the “Region” button is chosen. Right now users can choose multiple regions, but the plots are not able to show more than the first region selected. 
For the world map, we wanted to have a choropleth map based on cities but could not find a geojson file which could link vega datasets with our dataset. Lastly, we also faced challenges with making the legend titles human readable for the world map plot and would like to work more on that. 

All in all, this was a great learning experience and we are happy with what we were able to accomplish so far.
